Zombie Balls
Zombie Balls is a fast-paced, mobile-optimized roguelike shooter where you play as a rolling, gunning ball battling endless waves of undead enemies â€” 
who are also, you guessed it, balls.

Survive as long as you can by defeating zombies to earn money and unlock new weapons, ammo, and automated turrets. Strategic upgrades are key to staying 
alive as the hordes grow stronger with each wave. Unlock four unique levels by reaching milestone waves and pushing your survival skills to the limit.

This game demonstrates my ability to design and optimize gameplay systems for mobile platforms, including resource management, enemy scaling, and performance optimization. 
I'm currently focused on another game and building my own custom engine, but Zombie Balls remains a complete and functional example of my solo development work.
